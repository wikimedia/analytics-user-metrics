    <h6>File Format</h6>
    <p>User Metrics expects a CSV file with the following format (the username, project header row is not required).  Do pay special attention to the use of underscore in user names.  Most user names do not have underscores but may be recorded that way in your file by people copying from a user page url.  If those users show up as invalid, you may want to try them with spaces instead of underscores.</p>
